"2022/02/09 3:14:04 AM EST","3","2","The docstring rendering is easier to read than the old docs page. Better colors and less clutter. Fits on screen better.","The first thing I did was click ""API ref"" in the right side menu, but it didn't take me to a new page. I would expect selecting from a menu on the right would then show new content about that topic.

It needs more sympy colors to feel like sympy's documentation.

The front page is quite boring with only four big headers. If you look at matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc. the front page is very engaging with the graphics and big buttons.

You have to click too many times to drill down to seeing an actual page with information on it. In the old docs you have a big ToC on the front page and one click usually gets you to useful information.

Most pages feel too short. Web browsers can scroll (infinitely). It's preferable to make longer pages with hyperlink targets and table of contents menus.","2","","I can't really tell the difference in this one and the first one I was shown. So all the same comments apply.","2","","Same comment as last. Looks practically the same as the prior two. Same comments apply.","4","I like this one the best! The menu on the left works as expected. You click and it takes you to a new page of info. And then the menu expands letting you quickly navigate to new relevant content. I think if that big blue square in the top left was sympy green (and probably other blues need to be swapped to greens) then we have a winner!","Needs green in colors. Needs more engaging front page. There is a lot of prose style docs (often module docstring) in the API. That really needs to be move into one of the other big 4 groups of the documentation. The api should strictly be the docstrings of classes, functions, etc. ","The first 3 all look the same and have poorly designed menus that don't function as expected. It also seems that there are two menus on some, which is confusing. The last one RTD is really the only one that looks functional to me."

"2022/02/09 2:15:01 PM EST","3","3","Desktop: Clean look. The categories across the top. The search box in a fixed position on the left navbar. Good highlighting format (for ?highlight=xxx in URL). Good differentiation between regular text, links (bold, blue), and code (pink). Good permalink setup: ¶ appears when link text moused over, then ¶ highlights when moused over. Code blocks are clearly delineated (using gray box) and their background is the same as rest of page. Easy to triple-click to select a line of code from a code block. Phone: Fairly easy to copy code from a code block.","Desktop: In left navbar, not super-obvious which item this page is (highlighting not that strong). Distinction between h2 and h3 not that obvious, especially when h2 text is lowercase and h3 text is uppercase. Phone: Initial view of many pages (home, search) wastes a lot of vertical space. When tap a link in tree at top of page, there's no visible indication that the page content changed because link tree takes up entire screen height.","3","Desktop: Clear differentiation of headings from regular text, and h2 from h3; and current section in left navbar; due to blue color. Clear differentiation of function syntax and parameters due to background color. Permalinks nicely handled: ¶ appears when mouse over link text, then gets darker when mouse over ¶. Phone: Pretty good use of vertical space. Page content is front and center, and nicely presented when go to a new page. Previous and Next links at bottom of page give visitor suggestions of where to go next.","Phone: Icons at top right (fullscreen and download) unlikely to be used often, and draw visitor's attention. No index (link tree) for within current page. No constant reminder of which site I'm on--could we add ""SymPy"" or the logo to the header, between hamburger menu and two icons at top right?","3","Desktop: Clear differentiation between headings and regular text, and h2 from h3. Pretty clear which is current section on left navbar due to bolding. Permalink setup pretty good: ¶ appears when mouse over link text, cursor turns to hand when mouse over ¶. Phone: Having two hamburger menus, one for site tree and one for sections-on-this-page tree. Always displays site title at top.","Desktop: Not a big fan of background color in code blocks; could be improved by making the color lighter (less saturated). Phone: Bit of an ""interference effect"" when scroll vertically as top title bar hides (?) page content.","1","Desktop: Headings are nice and bold. Clear differentiation of h2 from h3. Using increasingly opaque colors in left navbar demonstrates where in site tree visitor is. Permalinks pretty good: ¶ appears when mouse over link text, cursor changes when mouse over ¶. Phone: .","Previous and Next links don't display what those page titles are (until visitor mouses over). Desktop: Not a big fan of color backgrounds of left navbar and especially to the right of page content; could be improved by changing colors. Determining which page vistior is on, in left navbar, could be easier: highlighting of current page is link a little weak. Phone: Very much dislike how left navbar pushes page content to the right; prefer overlay style of other themes. Very much dislike that there's no way to navigate to another page, or jump to another section of this page, after visitor scrolls down, because the hamburger menu isn't sticky.","PyData, Book, and Furo would all be good choices.
Category names (SymPy Tutorial, SymPy Guides, Explanation, Reference Documentation, Miscellaneous) should be shortened, for example remove ""SymPy"", change ""Reference Documentation"" to API(?)."
